=== Building Fifengine on Mac

==== Environment: IDE and build tools

===== IDE

The are several good IDEs available, including:

* http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/[XCode]
** http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26#windows[Downloading CodeBlocks for Windows]
* https://code.visualstudio.com/download[Microsoft "Visual Studio Code"]
** https://code.visualstudio.com/download[Download "Visual Studio Code"]

===== Compiler

===== CMake

===== SWIG

===== Python (2.7+)

==== Dependencies

Fife depends on a multitude of external libraries.

Our next step is to ensure that all dependencies are installed properly.
We do this by either compiling and installing them manually or by fetching and installing pre-compiled binaries.

We do not provide a pre-packaged software development kit for Mac.

Additionally, you find more detailed information in the dependencies chapter.

===== Building dependencies from source

===== Using packaged dependencies

==== Building Fifengine

Finally, we can compile Fifengine.
