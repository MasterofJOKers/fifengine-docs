=== Building Fifengine on Windows

==== Environment: IDE and build tools

===== IDE

The are several good IDEs available, including:

* https://www.visualstudio.com/[Microsoft Visual Studio]
** https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/[Download Visual Studio Community]
** https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691978&clcid=0x409[Download Visual Studio Community - Webinstaller (english)]
** https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691978&clcid=0x407[Download Visual Studio Community - Webinstaller (german)]
* https://code.visualstudio.com/download[Microsoft "Visual Studio Code" Editor]
** https://code.visualstudio.com/download[Download "Visual Studio Code"]
* http://codeblocks.org/[CodeBlocks]
** http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26#windows[Downloading CodeBlocks for Windows]

===== Compiler

You need msvc or gcc or mingw-gcc. 

In case you installed MS Visual Studio, then the MSVC compiler is already installed.

In case you want to build using `gcc`, we suggest using one of the following toolchains:

* http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/[tdragon's TDM-GCC MinGW]
** This compiler and toolchain is also included in our Fife-SDK for MinGW.
* http://mingw-w64.org/[MinGW-W64]

===== CMake

Fife uses CMake as build system. The build system generates the build configuration for the project and set the project up for your specific IDE.

===== SWIG

Fife uses Swig as interface generator. Fife itself is written in C++, for being able to access the API from Python, we are wrapping it using Swig.

===== Python (2.7+)

To build the Python extension you need Python. Fife works with Python 2.7+. 

NOTE: We are working on Python 3 support.

** https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/[Python Downloads for Windows]
** https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.12/python-2.7.12.msi[Download Python 2.7.12 (msi)]
** https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/python-3.5.2.exe[Download Python 3.5.2 (exe)]

==== Dependencies

===== Building dependencies from source

===== Using packaged dependencies

==== Building Fifengine

Finally, we can compile Fifengine.
