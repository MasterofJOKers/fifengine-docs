== Compiling Fifengine

Compiling Fifengine is a complicated and time consuming task.
This chapter explains how to setup a compilation environment for Fife.

You'll find detailed setup steps for fifengine on the operating systems Linux, Windows and Mac.

The individual subchapters have the same structure:

Firstly, we'll setup an IDE, then the compiler toolchain and additionally needed build-tools.

Secondly, we'll discuss how to get all the dependencies, either by building them from source or by using pre-build binaries.

Thirdly, we'll show how to build fifengine itself.

Without further ado, let's get started.
