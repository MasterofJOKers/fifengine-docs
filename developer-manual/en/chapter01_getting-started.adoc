== Getting Started

Fife is a cross platform game creation framework written in C++.
Compiling Fifengine is a complicated task. 
You'll need time to set up your development environment, 
install all the build-tools, install or build all required dependencies 
for finally being able to build fifengine itself.

This chapter explains how to setup a compilation environment for Fife.
We'll find detailed setup steps for the following operating systems: Linux, Windows and Mac.
