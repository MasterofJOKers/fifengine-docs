## Fife Windows SDK

The Fife SDK build scripts fetch all required packages for working with fifengine, including build-tools and dependencies,
build the "SDK" installers on Appveyor (and deploy them to Github Releases).

This chapter documents the build scripts and tasks, including fetching and extracting components and compiling the InnoSetup installers.
