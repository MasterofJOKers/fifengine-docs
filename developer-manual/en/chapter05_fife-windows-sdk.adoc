## Fife Windows SDK

The Fife Windows SDK is a collection of software development tools for working with Fifengine.

The Fife SDK installer build scripts fetch all required packages for working with fifengine, including build-tools and dependencies,
build the "SDK" installers on Appveyor (and deploy them to Github Releases).

This chapter documents these build scripts and tasks, including fetching and extracting components and compiling the InnoSetup installers.

## Building the Installer

The installer is build using the InnoSetup Compiler (`iscc`).
The property `APP_VERSION` is set from the APPVEYOR environment as `%APPVEYOR_BUILD_VERSION%`, so that the installer is dynamically versionized from the outside.

`build-tools\innosetup\iscc /DAPP_VERSION=%APPVEYOR_BUILD_VERSION% installer\fife-sdk.iss`

The target location for installer is: `fife-windows-sdk\_build`.
