== What is Fifengine?

Flexible Isometric Free Engine (FIFE) is a multi-platform isometric game engine written in {cpp}. 
It comes with Python bindings allowing users to create games using Python as well as {cpp}. 
The engine is extendable and enables you to add any feature you can imagine to your project.

It's a very flexible game creation framework and not tied to any genre, 
but geared towards an RTS or RPG using an isometric or top-down view style.

This manual describes how to use FIFE to power your game.
