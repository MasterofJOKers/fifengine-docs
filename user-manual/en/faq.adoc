=== What features does FIFE support?

For a full list a features please visit our [[Features]] page.

=== Does FIFE support any scripting languages?

Yes! We use SWIG to generate Python bindings. See [SWIG's](http://www.swig.org/) homepage for more information on SWIG. At this time we only generate Python bindings.

=== Do you have any plans on supporting other scripting languages?

Not in the immediate future.

=== Will the engine support network features so you can create multiplayer games based on FIFE?

FIFE does NOT have any network code at the moment so it does not support
multiplayer games. We are however hoping to add networking support in the
future. We are currently looking for developers who have experience in writing
network code.
