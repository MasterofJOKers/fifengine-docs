== Games using Fifengine

The following projects are using Fife as their engine. 

We work closely with both Unknown Horizons and Zero-Projekt to continue to improve fife.

Unknown Horizons::  A realtime strategy game with economy simulation. This project is in very active development.
Zero-Projekt::      A turn-based post apocalyptic RPG. Check out some videos from Zero-Project here.
PARPG::             A post-apocalyptic roleplaying game inspired by Fallout, Planescape: Torment & Arcanum (development ceased).

Please note that this is by no means a complete list. 

If you are developing a game with fife and want it posted here let us know!
